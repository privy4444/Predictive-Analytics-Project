# Predictive-Analytics-Project
Loan Approval Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project applies predictive analytics and machine learning techniques to forecast loan approval outcomes. By analyzing a real-world dataset from Kaggle, it simulates the decision-making process financial institutions face when evaluating loan applications. Through data cleaning, exploratory analysis, model training, and ethical evaluation, the aim of the project was to build accurate and explainable models that support better decision-making for credit risk and lending departments.

Project objectives and what the analysis aims to accomplish

•	Identify key factors influencing loan approval decisions.
•	Develop interpretable models that predict loan approval status.
•	Support departments such as Credit Risk, Marketing, and Lending Officers with data-driven insights.
•	Reflect on the ethical implications of automated loan approval systems, with a focus on fairness and transparency.
